    "prompt": "A veterinarian gently examining a joyful dog in a modern clinic. The scene is lit with natural, soft light that gives a warm, early morning glow. The colors are mid-saturation with warm neutrals, forest greens, and golden ambers. The whites in the room are warm, not yellow, and the grays are soft. The environment includes subtle accents of 'Healing Meadow' green in the veterinarian's clothing and 'Sunlit Pulse' amber in the clinic's furniture. The composition is editorial documentary style, with a shallow depth of field to focus on the interaction between the veterinarian and the dog. The mood is calm and compassionate, showing a grounded professionalism with a sense of gentle optimism. The clinic is clean and organized, with natural materials like wood and fabric softening the environment. There are no posed smiles, just genuine interaction and eye contact between the veterinarian and the dog.",
